Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

I decided to make a class that represents a Bug. I based my class on an energy system that would allow the bug to do certain activities only if it had enough energy. The Bug is able to do certain activites/actions implemented using the functions in the Contract class and the the energy of the bug is reduced based on the avtivites that it completes. I used the rest() and grow() interface methods to increase the energy and size of the bug and methods such as fly(), walk(), and grab() to decrease the bug's energy. This class could be used to create a "growth" or "life" game where the user could manipulate the bug's daily activites and help it "grow". 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

I did not implement any additional methods but if I had time I might have added functions such as eat(), gather(), bite(), and maybe something like circus() as a reference to A Bugs Life.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think that this assignment went very well. I really liked that we had more freedom to choose what we wanted to do, which I think allowed me to think more creatively in a fun way. To someone taking this course in the future, I would give the normal advice of starting early and I would also say to have fun with it!
